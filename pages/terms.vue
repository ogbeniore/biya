We may assign these Terms at any time without notice.

      <p>In the event that any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, any provision that by its nature or express terms should survive will survive such termination or expiration. </p>
      <h3>19. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h3>
      <p>19.1 Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Biya in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Biya agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be resolved by binding arbitration, using the Lagos State Multi-Door Court House. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms. </p>
      <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND BIYA ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION IN ADDITION TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED WITHIN THESE TERMS. </p>
      <p>19.2 Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 19.1, we and you both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (ii) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims. </p>
